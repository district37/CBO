# CBO
CBOs in District 37 (July 2023)

# How to modify CBO information/listing
To make smaller edits (ex. update a phone number, add a website, change description), enter the CBOd37.csv file. It's a spreadsheet turned into a block of text (more specifically, Comma-Separated Values file). You can scroll and find the text you want to change (use CMD+F to do this quickly) and update the text.

If you would like to make larger changes, feel free to create a new CBOd37.csv file to replace this one with.

This file has the original CBO list and descriptions. I recommend either adding/removing directly from a copy of it. If starting over from scratch, keep the headers and keywords (listed under "Type" and "Demographics") the same to avoid needing to re-write a lot of code. Once you're done with the Google Sheet, download it as a .csv file and name it CBOd37.csv and replace the original file.
